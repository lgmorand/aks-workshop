# The AKS Workshop

The former [AKS workshop](https://github.com/microsoft/aksworkshop) is now deprecated and has now been moved to another self-paced workshop: [Microsoft Learn](https://aka.ms/learn/aksworkshop). The repository is a fork to have a standalone workshop which can be played by CSA with their customers.
