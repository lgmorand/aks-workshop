Useful resources are provided to help you work through each task. If you're working through this as part of a team-based hack, ensure you make progress at a good pace by dividing the workload between team members where possible. This may mean anticipating work that might be required in a later task.

> **Hint**: If you get stuck, you can ask for help from the proctors. You may also choose to peek at the solutions.

### Core tasks

Running through this as part of a one-day workshop, you should be able to complete all the **Getting up and running** section. This involves setting up a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the application container from Azure Container Registry, and setting up monitoring.

### Optional tasks

Once you're done with the Core tasks, next would be to dive deeper into advanced topics. **Complete as many tasks as you can**. You'll be setting up advanced monitoring, deploying multiple microservices, enforcing security, and adding more resilience to your cluster.
