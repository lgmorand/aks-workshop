In this lab, you will be creating and deploying containers.

To ensure a smooth experience, please familiarize yourself beforehand with container basics using [Docker introduction on MS Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/). Alternatively, you can check [Docker's Get started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

If you are keen to explore the advanced optional sections, we strongly encourage you to have some prior knowledge of Kubernetes and its concepts. If you are new to Kubernetes, start with the [Kubernetes Learning Path](https://aka.ms/LearnKubernetes) to learn Kubernetes basics, then go through the concepts of [what Kubernetes is and what it isn't](https://aka.ms/k8sLearning).

If you are a more experienced Kubernetes developer or administrator, you may have a look at the [Kubernetes best practices ebook](https://aka.ms/aks/bestpractices).
