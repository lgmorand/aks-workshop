There is an assumption of some prior knowledge of Kubernetes and its concepts. If you are new to Kubernetes, start with the [Kubernetes Learning Path](https://aka.ms/LearnKubernetes) to learn Kubernetes basics, then go through the concepts of [what Kubernetes is and what it isn't](https://aka.ms/k8sLearning).

If you are a more experienced Kubernetes developer or administrator, you may have a look at the [Kubernetes best practices ebook](https://aka.ms/aks/bestpractices).
